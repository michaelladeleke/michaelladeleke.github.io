project_title: "Integrating Physiological Sensors and Robotics for Educational Innovation: The mBot Neo Project"

problem: |
  There is a lack of research focusing on exploring ways to build educational software that integrates physical robots and physiological sensors.

approach: |
  During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Capture physiological data such as EEG and EMG from the human body.
  - Process raw sensor data and classify events such as gestures (e.g., arm movements) and emotional states (e.g., attention levels)
  - Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot.

outcome: |
  The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program. The poster will focus on the systemâ€™s technical architecture.
