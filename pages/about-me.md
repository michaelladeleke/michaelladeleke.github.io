  bio: |
    I’m a senior Computer Science student at Morgan State University and a researcher in the Human-AI eXperience (HAX) Lab. My interests include artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and computer science education. I’ve led outreach efforts through CodeBears, a summer STEM initiative for underrepresented youth, and have presented my work at national conferences. I’m currently preparing to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science.
