what_i_learned: |
  We covered many topics during our Python 101 session. This included “True and False”, “Boolean”, and “If and Else”. These codes can be plugged into a program to receive exact results. I learned that you must tell the computer every detail so the program can understand what you are trying to do. We were able to apply our knowledge by using replit and playing kahoot. This allowed us to see where we really are at.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  	I can see the progress of my python knowledge. I’ve ensured myself to ask a lot of questions. This expanded my thoughts to see how to execute different python programs. After lunch we had a presentation on Generative AI. How AI generates certain results. Learning, Thinking, and Communicating. We generated our own product. I made a song using “suno”. We played kahoot to confirm the information we learned in the presentation. We talked about ”LLMS”. This stands for Large Language Models.
